	        "spm3",		// DONE 244	At the end of VAS1SC56, triggered immediately before the Countess says, "Senor Stobbart, if I find that you are wasting my time..."
	        "spm4",		// DONE 245	Immediately before Lopez enters the mausoleum with the chess set.
	        "spm5",		// DONE 246	(This is actually 5m2 copied for CD2) Played through the chess puzzle. Ideally, when it finsishes, give it a couple of seconds and then launch 12m1. When that finishes,  a couple of seconds and then back to this and so on and so forth.
	        "spm6",		// DONE 247	On fade up from completing the chess puzzle. The climax is now "spm6b"
	        "scm1",		// DONE 248	This is used whenever George goes out of a carriage and onto the corridor.
	        "scm2",		// DONE 249	As George climbs out of the train window.

	        "scm6",		// DONE 253	Before, "He's dead"
	        "scm7",		// DONE 254	Kissing Nico. After, "Where do you think you're going?"

	        "rm3b",		// DONE 258	The scene change immediately after Eklund says, "If you wish to live much longer..."
	        "scm16",	// DONE 259	The big end sequence from when the torch hits the gunpowder. Cross fade with the shortened version that fits on the Smacker.

	        "scm1b",	// DONE 260	When George passes the trigger point toward the back of the train and he sees Guido.
	        "spm6b",	// DONE 261 The climax of "spm6", which should coincide with the Countess holding up the chalice.

	        "rm4",		// DONE 263 "On crystal stand icon. As George walks to the center of the cavern." I'd do this on the first LMB on the stump.

	        "rm6",		// DONE 265 "Chalice reflection. On icon as George places Chalice on floor of Church" i.e. the mosaic in the Baphomet dig. It's over thirty seconds long so it had best start running when the chalice luggage is placed on the mosaic so it runs through the big screen of the reflection.
	        "rm7",		// DONE 266 "Burning candle. On icon as George sets about lighting candle." One minute forty-eight, this one. I've no idea how long the burning candle Smacker is but the cue description seems to indicate it should run from the moment the burning tissue successfully lights the candle, i.e. the window is shut.
	        "rm8",		// DONE 267 "Down well. George descends into circus trap well." I think the circus reference refers to the lion. Run it from the moment that George gets off the rope and has a look around. Run it once only.

	        "rm3c",		// DONE 268 On the scene change to the Grand Master standing between the pillars as the earth power whomps him.
	        "rm3d",		// DONE 269 ONe the scene change after the Grand Master says, "George, we have watched you..." This one might need a bit of fiddling to get it to match to the fisticuffs.
